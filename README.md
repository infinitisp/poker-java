Poker programs by TheDarkJoker

This is 3 programs and some shared libraries for support (which are mostly borrowed from elsewhere):

#### 1 PowerRanger

Basic range vs range evaluator using monte carlo that accepts top push / low equity push and call ranges

#### 2 Equilibrium EV

Calculate EV and find Nash Equilibrium for Bvb scenarios

#### 3 Calling practice

Drills for various preflop shortstack spots ("call a shove" or "shove or fold" practice)
